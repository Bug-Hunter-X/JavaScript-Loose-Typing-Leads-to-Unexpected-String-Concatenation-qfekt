This example demonstrates a common JavaScript pitfall: the loose typing system. When you add a number and a string, JavaScript performs string concatenation instead of numerical addition. This can lead to unexpected results and bugs that are difficult to track down. The solution involves explicit type checking or using the Number() function to ensure that the operands are numbers before performing the addition.
